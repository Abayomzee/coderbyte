## Why does this repository exist?

The purpose of this repository is to practice integrating several elements of software development.  These include, but are not limited to:

* Algorithms implementation
* Git workflow
* Writing unit tests using Jest

Secondly, I have used this project to get used to using several other supplemental tools:

* ESLint
* Prettier
* JSDoc

I am using the practice I gain here in order to transition into behavior-driven development.
